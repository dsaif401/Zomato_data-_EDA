# Zomato_data-_EDA
In this project I tried to find different patterns by performing exploratory data analysis.
The dataset is of Zomato which contains attributes like 'Restaurant ID', 'Country Code', 'City','Cuisines','Average Cost for two', 'Currency','Has Online delivery','Price range', 'Aggregate rating', 'Rating color', 'Rating text','Votes'

1) Most of the transaction happens from India ,USA and UK respectively
2) Rating for 4.5 to 4.9 --> Excellent
3) Rating for 4.0 to 4.4 --> Very good
4) Rating for 3.5 to 3.9 --> Good product
5) Rating for 2.5 to 3.4 --> Average product
6) rating for 1.8 to 2.4 --> poor product
